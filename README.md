Trying to implement the Game of Life completely based on MVVM pattern without any external libs.

The game already has:
- MVVM pattern supporting.
- Modern UI without external frameworks.
- Extendable ViewModels base.
- Dark theme.

The game will include:
- Changed simulation parameters like speed, density, etc.
- Logging simulation progress.
- Generation counter.
- Different languages.
- Many other features; the list will continue.
